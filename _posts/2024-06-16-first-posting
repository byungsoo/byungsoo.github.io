Many years ago, I was using telnet (`telnet bar.xxx.yy.zz`) to post things on the college's private [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) (yes, very old system). On my board, most of the items were about daily stuff, comic books, movies, and sometimes cool techy things. Within the BBS system, it was possible to navigate through other friends' (including non-friends) boards, and it was interesting to see their interests in music, politics, science, religion, etc. Similarly, my friends often came to my board and commented on my postings, and they were all good old memories.

Many years have passed, and my interests have also shifted to some degree. I’ll blog about some of my favorites from books and movies. I’ll also be writing something on AI research, software, and related business.

Let's see how it goes. :crossed_fingers:
